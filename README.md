# Momentic GitHub Actions demo

This repo uses the [Momentic CLI](https://docs.momentic.ai/cli/installation) to:

1. Sync local test files to Momentic cloud on every push to `main`.
2. Trigger Momentic cloud test runs on every push to `main`.
3. Run local tests against a local React app on every pull request.
